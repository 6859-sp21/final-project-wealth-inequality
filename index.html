    <h1>Understanding a Simple Model for Wealth Distribution: Market Capitalism Leads to High Inequalities</h1>
    <h2>An interactive simulation-based approach to policies for wealth inequality.</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>In this work, we present an innovative interactive article format with embedded wealth inequality simulations. We aim to make economic and mathematical models of wealth distributions more accessible to an average user, allowing policymakers and the public to understand how changing various parameters and policies can shift wealth inequality. Our simulation is based on the Yard Sale Model, which is in agreement with empirical data of an average error less than 0.16%. In every situation run in the simulation without a wealth tax—even with a low fraction transacted and a high level of “fairness”—the wealth distribution inevitably concentrates wealth in the top 5% bracket of the agents. The moment a wealth tax is implemented, the distribution shifts. It does not remove the existence of economic class differences, but ensures that no small segment of the population holds more than 50% of the total wealth. The implications of our work suggest that a wealth tax or other wealth redistribution policies are crucial to preventing the exacerbation of already high socioeconomic inequalities. </p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In a 2013 speech for the Center for American Progress, former President Barack Obama described rising inequality
        as the &quot;defining challenge of our time.&quot;<dt-cite key="newell_obama_2013"></dt-cite> Despite his administration&rsquo;s promise to focus their
        efforts on addressing inequalities, the United States continues to be one of the most unequal of the developed
        nations, surpassed only by Chile, Mexico, and Turkey.<dt-cite key="roser_income_2013"></dt-cite> In fact, wealth inequality appears to be rising in most
        developing nations, including those with a model of welfare-state capitalism, such as countries in continental and
        Nordic Europe.<dt-cite key="bird_why_nodate"></dt-cite></p>

    <p>Proponents of market capitalism argue that minimal government intervention results in a fair distribution of
        wealth, with market prices in equilibrium with supply and demand. Milton Friedman, the father of modern
        libertarian thought, believed that a free market could organize and distribute resources efficiently.<dt-cite key="friedman_friedman_nodate"></dt-cite> Any
        remaining inequalities are the product of just disparity, where every individual owns the amount of wealth that
        they have earned. By this argument, the poor are trapped in poverty because of their lack of productivity rather
        than any structural unfairness in the system.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, in his landmark 2014 work Capital in the 21st Century, French economist Thomas Piketty argues
        that capitalism has an inherent tendency to create very high degrees of wealth and income inequality because in
        capitalist economies, the rate of return on capital (\(r\)) is greater than the general growth rate (\(g\)).<dt-cite key="milanovic_return_2014"></dt-cite>
        Because of this &ldquo;\(r>g\)&rdquo; dynamic, we can expect capitalism, unchecked, to hand most economic and
        political power to the richest classes, and the ultra-wealthy in particular. This is true even for welfare-state
        capitalism. The welfare state merely provides social insurance; it has no built-in mechanism for compressing the
        inequalities of wealth required to dampen the power of \(r>g\).<dt-cite key = "yglesias_short_2014"></dt-cite></p>

                The Gini coefficient<dt-cite key="bureau_gini_nodate"></dt-cite> incorporates the detailed shares data into a single statistic, which summarizes the 
                dispersion of income across the entire income distribution. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0, indicating 
                perfect equality (where everyone receives an equal share), to 1, perfect inequality (where only one 
                recipient or group of recipients receives all the income). Data Source: World Bank Indicators, 2018.<dt-cite key = "noauthor_povcalnet_nodate"></dt-cite></center>

    </figure>

    <p>Despite seemingly opposite arguments on wealth inequality which are often correlated with political ideology, a
        2011 study found that U.S. citizens across the political spectrum dramatically underestimate the current level
        of wealth inequality in the U.S., and would prefer a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth.<dt-cite key="cagetti_wealth_nodate"></dt-cite></p>

    <p>Piketty and other economists have proposed a solution to growing inequalities: a modest global wealth tax. He
        proposes that major economies cooperate to establish a global wealth tax that prevents the rich from shifting
        assets into other countries to avoid paying taxes in their own country. Even if there is a lack of global
        cooperation, Piketty suggests that large economies like the U.S. and European Union should create their own
        wealth and inheritance taxes to provide a temporary resolve from the dangers of the growing wealth gap.</p>
    <h3>Modeling Wealth Distributions: Related Work</h3>
    <p>In the past 30 years, the development of datasets from sources like the Survey of Consumer Finances allowed
        economists and mathematicians to quantify the degree of wealth distribution in the United States and abroad.
        Analysis of these surveys confirm that wealth is extremely concentrated in the U.S.: the top 1% hold one third
        of total wealth, the richest 5% hold more than half, and the bottom 40% hold little to no wealth at all.<dt-cite key="cagetti_wealth_nodate"></dt-cite></p>

    <p>The emergence of these datasets also allows economists to develop and refine models for understanding wealth
        distributions. A class of these models, called Asset-Exchange Models (AEMs) involve individual agents whose
        wealth changes due to binary transactions with other agents.<dt-cite key = "boghosian_growth_2016"></dt-cite> An analogy to AEMs is kinetic theory, which
        describes molecules whose momentum and energy change due to interactions with other molecules. AEMs were first
        introduced in 1986 and provide idealized but useful methods to understanding wealth distributions. A recent
        paper by Jie Li, Bruce M.Boghosian, and Chengli Li demonstrates that, with appropriate features included, AEMs
        are capable of accurately modeling and explaining empirical economic data.<dt-cite key="li_affine_2019"></dt-cite></p>

    <p>In this paper, we create an interactive version of the Extended Yard-Sale Model (EYSM), a variant of the
        Asset-Exchange Model first proposed in 2002 and refined in 2016 to include the idea of Wealth-Attained Average
        (WAA), which accounts for the privileges of the wealthy, like higher investment returns and lower interest
        rates.<dt-cite key = "boghosian_describing_2016"></dt-cite> While many academic works have produced models that can replicate real-world data with remarkable
        accuracy, most of these models remain locked in an ivory tower, inaccessible and incomprehensible by a general
        audience. We aim to visualize an existing model in a way that is welcoming to the average user, allowing them to
        understand the factors that influence wealth distribution and see for themselves the effect of different
        policies on the wealth gap.</p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>We used the Plotly Express<dt-cite key="noauthor_plotly_nodate"></dt-cite> library in Python to generate the interactive graphs above. The interactive simulations below were
        created using D3.js.<dt-cite key = "bostock_d3js_nodate"></dt-cite>
        The code snippet below shows the basic function that calculates individual transactions for all the simulations we present.</p>

    <dt-code block language="javascript">
        function transaction(event) {
            const wealthA = individuals[0].size;
            const wealthB = individuals[1].size;
            const a_pays = Math.random() < 0.5;
            let payment_amount = Math.min(wealthA, wealthB) * fracTransacted;
            if ((wealthA < wealthB) === a_pays)
                payment_amount *= (1 - fairness);
            draw_transfer(Math.round(payment_amount * (a_pays ? 1 : -1)))
        }
    </dt-code>
    <p>As you can see, the premise behind the wealth inequality model is encompassed in a relatively simple function.</p>
    <p>We took an experimental approach to this paper, writing it in a format that would be accessible to academics, policymakers,
    and the general public. Using the interactive article format of Distill.pub<dt-cite key = "noauthor_distill_nodate"></dt-cite>, which is normally used for machine learning
    research, we embedded interactive visualizations into the paper that simulate the mathematical models used to predict
    wealth distribution outcomes. This retains a more academic format for economists and researchers, while allowing policymakers
    and general users to interact with and understand the model even without a mathematical or economic background. Our guiding
    values in the work were transparency and accessibility, which we retain by catering to a diverse range of audiences and
    reducing jargon as much as possible. Our hope is that this interactive paper format will help a broad table of stakeholders make better informed
    policy decisions when deciding how to reduce economic inequalities in society.</p>



    <h3>Our Interactive Model</h3>
    <p>In our interactive adaptation of the Extended Yard-Sale Model,<dt-cite key = "boghosian_describing_2016"></dt-cite> we first present a free market closed economy
        without a wealth tax. To understand a single transaction between agents, consider two agents, Agent A and Agent
        B.</p>

    <p>Agent A has some positive amount of wealth w and is transacting with Agent B, who has some positive amount of
        wealth \(x\). During this transaction, Agent A’s wealth is increased by \(\Delta w\), while Agent B’s wealth is
        decreased by \(\Delta w\), which can be positive or negative depending on \(\eta\) (representing a coin flip).

        $$ \Delta w = \gamma \cdot min(w, x)\eta $$</p>

    <p>We model the Wealth-Attained Average, which simulates privilege, by biasing the coin flip. The bias is
        proportional to the difference between the two agents’ wealth normalized by the average wealth and multiplied by
        a WAA coefficient of the bias (\(\zeta)\), given by the expectation value of \(\eta\):

        $$E[\eta ] = \zeta \cdot \frac{w-x}{\frac{W}{N}}$$ where \(W\) is the total wealth \(w+x\), \(n\) = number of
        agents (2)</p>

    <p>If the poorer agent is transferring to the wealthier agent, \(\Delta w\) is multiplied by a fairness coefficient
        of \(0 \leq \epsilon \leq 0.1\), representing charity and other social welfare programs that benefit the
        poor.</p>

    <p>In the simulation of a binary agent transaction below, modify the initial wealth of the agents, the fairness
        coefficient, and the fraction of the wealth transacted. Then continue to click the “Transaction” button,
        modifying the parameters when desired, to see how the wealth of the agents change over time. we suggest clicking the "Transaction"
        button at least 10-20 times to gain a clear picture of how transactions between agents work.</p>

        <figcaption>
            <center>Transaction Simulator</center>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Now we extend this model of transaction between two agents to \(n\) = 1000 agents and run infinite iterations of
        transactions. Modify the parameters below to see how the wealth distribution of the system of agents changes
        over time. Feel free to change the sliders as the simulation runs. Adjust the speed to slow down or increase the speed of the simulation.
        The color of each bar represents the total wealth of the agents within the bin. This is encoded by the total wealth multiplied by the number of agents. </p>

        <figcaption>
            <center>Economy Simulator</center>
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Next, we make a simple change: implementing a wealth tax. For every transaction, a wealth tax given by

        $$ \chi (\bar w-w)$$ where \(0 \leq \chi \leq 1\) is added to the transacted amount \(\Delta w\).</p>

    <p>Now we again extend this model of transaction between two agents to \(n\) = 1000 agents and run infinite
        iterations of transactions. Modify the parameters below to see how the wealth distribution of the system of
        agents changes over time.</p>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Compared to the simulation without a wealth tax, you should observe a clear shift in the distribution with a wealth tax.
        There are no small brackets of the population with highly concentrated wealth, and overall, there are fewer agents in extreme poverty (wealth of about 0-10).
    </p>
    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>
    We note several simplifications in our model that do not accurately represent the real world. First, we do not account for negative wealth in the
    version of the Yard Sale Model<dt-cite key="boghosian_describing_2016"></dt-cite> that we implement, so there is no representation of debt or loans given. Second, we present a highly simplified
    form of the wealth tax. In reality, the wealth tax would only apply to the top 1% wealth-holders in the population and would be implemented through
    taxes on inheritance, real estate, stock assets, and income in a far more nuanced way. Third, our indicator for "fairness" is exaggerated, as charity and
    welfare programs are voluntary and represent the willingness of people to donate their wealth, which is fairly unpredictable and difficult to represent
    in a single coefficient. While these simplifications seem to produce a highly elementary model of our true wealth dynamics, a paper that studies the
    Yard Sale Model, which is what our simulation is based on, finds that the model is in agreement with empirical data of an average error less than
    0.16% over this time period.<dt-cite key = "li_affine_2019"></dt-cite>
    </p>
    <p>
    Our visual design in this paper and embedded visualizations aims to communicate a clean, polished, and simple layout. We intentionally reduce the usage
    of colors to a simple black-and-white palette to reduce complexity for the viewer and presenting them with exactly the number of parameters that exist in the model.
    This emphasizes that the seemingly difficult mathematical equations presented in academic papers, which we include in the body of our text,
    can actually be understood through simple concepts. One guiding value in our work was transparency. The design of our visualization makes sure to include
    every single parameter we mention in the paper as a clearly marked slider that the user can control. We make sure to include every variable in the equations
    as a dynamic factor because we want to make it clear that there are no "hidden" features influencing the results behind the scenes: the user is fully able
    to change the model as they please. This makes the ultimate implications of the simulation as plausible and persuasive as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    The implications of our work suggest that a wealth tax or other wealth redistribution policy is crucial to preventing the exacerbation of already high
    socioeconomic inequalities. In every situation run in the simulation without a wealth tax--even with a low fraction transacted and a high level of "fairness"--
    the wealth distribution inevitably concentrates wealth in the top 5% bracket of the agents. The moment a wealth tax is implemented, the distribution shifts. It does
    not remove the existence of economic class, but ensures that no tiny segment of the population holds more than 50% of the total wealth. Thus, even in our simple model,
    the wealth tax is a clear policy solution that makes far more impact than increasing social welfare and charity programs represented by the fairness coefficient.
    </p>
    <p>
    Corroborating our findings, countries with strong state welfare programs, like the Nordic models of democratic-socialism, are still experiencing
    increasing inequalities and unsustainable wealth gaps.<dt-cite key = "bird_why_nodate"></dt-cite> Without clear wealth redistribution policies, even welfare states (with high degrees of the
    fairness coefficient) succumb to a highly unequal wealth distribution. To combat this, we should further research wealth tax models, learning
    from the mistakes of European wealth taxes that were abolished in the last few decades.<dt-cite key="tankersley_warren_2021"></dt-cite> We must also realize that the system is inherently unfair:
    just like the agent in our transaction model is trapped in poverty if he starts with a low wealth, most of the world's poor have no escape.
    We should decrease the stigma around poverty and work to balance the extremes of the free market and state-run programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Work</h3>
    <p>
    In the future, this concept of interactive article simulations can be extended to more complex models, such as the Affine Wealth Model (AWM). This model
    expands on the Yard Sale Model by adding parameters that model negative wealth, a key factor missing from many wealth inequality simulators.<dt-cite key = "li_affine_2019"></dt-cite>
    In addition, models can incorporate policy solutions other than a uniform wealth tax, such as progressive income tax, the removal of inheritance
    tax loopholes, and bracketed wealth taxes. By giving users the ability to explore almost all policy solutions that currently exist, we allow
    the user themself to decide what is the most rational choice for their policy problem. The concept of this interactive paper could also be used
    in policy workshops, where experts in the field can use modular tools like the transaction simulator to understand the more complex equations
    presented in academic papers. A final vision for this work is similar to the EN-ROADS Climate Change Solutions Simulator,<dt-cite key="noauthor_en-roads_nodate"></dt-cite> which is
    a transparent, freely-available policy simulation model that gives users the chance to design their own scenarios to limit future global warming.
    Like EN-ROADS, a wealth inequality simulator would allow the audience to try their own experiments and assumptions, and get immediate feedback
    on the likely impacts on wealth distribution. A key strength is that it would be able to run on an ordinary laptop with an internet connection
    in a fraction of a second, allowing it to be used real-time at in-person and virtual education events. Ultimately, this interactive simulator is
    a step towards making complicated and pressing economic problems more accessible to the public, improving our response to global inequalities.

        abstract = {Wealth inequality in the United States, also known as the wealth gap, is the unequal distribution of assets among residents of the United States. Wealth commonly includes the values of any homes, automobiles, personal valuables, businesses, savings, and investments, as well as any associated debts. The net worth of U.S. households and non-profit organizations was \$107 trillion in the third quarter of 2019, a record level both in nominal terms and purchasing power parity. As of Q3 2019, the bottom 50\% of households had \$1.67 trillion, or 1.6\% of the net worth, versus \$74.5 trillion, or 70\% for the top 10\%. From an international perspective, the difference in US median and mean wealth per adult is over 600\%.
    
    U.S. Federal Reserve data indicates that from 1989 to 2020, U.S. net worth became increasingly concentrated with the top 1\% (roughly 11.1 million and above) and top 10\% wealthiest (roughly 1.2 million and above), due in large part to corporate stock ownership concentration in those segments of the population; the bottom 50\% have little if any corporate stock. Just prior to  President Barack Obama's 2014 State of the Union Address, media reported that the wealthiest 1\% of Americans possess 40\% of the nation's wealth; the bottom 80\% own 7\%. The gap between the wealth of the top 10\% and that of the middle class is over 1,000\%; that increases another 1,000\% for the top 1\%. The average employee "needs to work more than a month to earn what the CEO earns in one hour."Although different from income inequality, the two are related. In Inequality for All—a 2013 documentary, narrated by Robert Reich, in which he argues that income inequality is the defining issue of the United States—Reich states that 95\% of economic gains following the economic recovery which began in 2009 went to the top 1\% of Americans (by net worth) (HNWI). More recently, in 2017, an Oxfam study found that only eight people, six of them Americans, own as much combined wealth as half the human race.A 2011 study found that US citizens across the political spectrum dramatically underestimate the current level of wealth inequality in the US, and would prefer a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth.Wealth is usually not used for daily expenditures or factored into household budgets, but combined with income, it represents a family's total opportunity to secure stature and a meaningful standard of living, or to pass their class status down to their children. Moreover, wealth provides for both short- and long-term financial security, bestows social prestige, contributes to political power, and can be leveraged to obtain more wealth. Hence, wealth provides mobility and agency—the ability to act. The accumulation of wealth enables a variety of freedoms, and removes limits on life that one might otherwise face. Dennis Gilbert asserts that the standard of living of the working and middle classes is dependent primarily upon income and wages, while the rich tend to rely on wealth, distinguishing them from the vast majority of Americans. A September 2014 study by Harvard Business School declared that the growing disparity between the very wealthy and the lower and middle classes is no longer sustainable.},

In a model of WAA for which the bias is a continuous function of the wealth difference of the transacting agents, the condensation was shown to arise from a second-order phase transition to a coexistence regime. In this paper, we present the first analytic time-dependent results for this model, by showing that the condensed wealth obeys a logistic equation in time.},
